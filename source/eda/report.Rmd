## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Mann-Whitney-Pettitt Test

The **Mann-Whitney-Pettitt** test is used to detect change points in the AMS data.

 - The computed K-statistic is 914 and the corresponding p-value is 0.022.
 - At a significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is a potential change point in 1974.
