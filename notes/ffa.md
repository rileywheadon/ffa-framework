# Flood Frequency Analysis

## Plan

Porting scripts to R:

- Write statistical tests from scratch.
- Use `ggplot2` as a plotting framework.
- Write unit tests to compare results with MATLAB.

Then, once I have a good framework in R, improve MATLAB code.

Finally, build a GUI application, a web app, and port to CRAN.

Alternatively, work on adding more features/tests to the framework.

## Todo

- [ ] Implement Pettitt test
- [ ] Test Pettitt implementation
- [ ] Implement MKS test
- [ ] Test MKS implementation
